Please remember follows:
Bypass is a special test mode. it is disabled by default and it is not public and special test version for the customer.
It should not distribute to public.

The step thru to work-around is:
1. Uninstall printer driver verion #166.
2. Install printer driver verion #167.
3. Execute LW5xx_V2_enable_bypass.reg to enable bypass mode on citrix.

NOTE:
1. Execute LW5xx_V2_disabel_bypass.reg to revert enabled bypass mode on citrix in future.
2. If you add network printer to Citrix OS directly, you will have problems. Driver can communicate with network printer directly, so bypass mode will break direct printing since all retry/recovery mechanisms are disabled in bypass mode.
